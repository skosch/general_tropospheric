        <h1>Color-separating elements</h1>

        <h2>Separation of light sources</h2>
        Different lights, different phosphors, different spectra.

        <h2>Rayleigh scattering</h2>
        <p>
        Rayleigh scattering, particularly of blue light, requires particles much smaller than the wavelength of the blue light.
        Sizes well below 100nm are best. Such particles are cheaply available in the form of silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) or titania (TiO<sub>2</sub>) powder
        (the latter is somewhat preferable because its scattering is stronger; its refractive index is 2.5 vs silica's 1.45).
        </p>
        <p>
        However, it turns out that in order to create the scattering "window", one must disperse this powder within the "windowpane", i.e. the
        epoxy or acrylic resin that will cure to form a layer through which the light will shine, and dispersing this powder uniformly
        is very challenging as the particles tend to form microscopic clumps, which are quite a bit larger than 100nm, give a milky appearance,
        and Mie-scatter all wavelengths of light (i.e. one makes sunscreen). Instead, monodisperse solutions should be fairly transparent.
        While some internet posters have reported some success using ultrasonic mixing equipment to break up the agglomerates,
        this appears to be more effort than it's worth.
        </p>
        <p>
        Many industrial suppliers offer transparent, pre-mixed monodisperse solutions of silica or titania nanoparticles for sale. They usually come in
        fairly high concentrations (40-50%) and are meant to be used as an additive (at closer to 10%) for resin mixes used in stereolithographic 3D printing
        and in coatings (e.g. for vehicles or marine applications), the promise being higher material strength, scratch resistance, hydrophobicity, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
        These are not outrageously expensive; tens of dollars for a large bottle. Some examples:

        <h2>Pre-made Rayleigh scattering panels</h2>
        <p>
            The panels used by CoeLux, Yeelight, etc. are presumably manufactured by curing such a monodisperse particle solution in a panel-shaped mold.

            They are available for sale on the Chinese web; look for 板瑞利散射板. The cost depends on the size (tens of dollars for a square meter), but shipping
            is the more expensive part. Unfortunately, getting them shipped abroad is a major hassle: the websites
            are entirely in Chinese, the stores are unreliable (I've had to fight for a refund when the store just disappeared after payment) and
            shipping internationally requires an Alipay account, which can only be recharged with a Chinese bank card (or you'll have to work with middle men).
        </p>

        <h2>DIY scattering panel or coating</h2>
        <p>
          The resins can be purchased and used to create a panel directly (TODO).
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, they can be used to coat a mirror (see <a href="reflective.html">Reflective elements</a>).
            This results in an optically clear coat which nevertheless exhibits excellent Rayleigh scattering both on the incident and reflected light path.
        </p>

        <h2>Inkjet printing transparency foil</h2>
        <p>
            Available in rolls or letter-sized sheets, they are covered in ultrafine silica powder, which is supposed to help absorb the ink.
            Internet users claim that waterproof ones are better suited than regular ones. This has been difficult to verify, due to the
            lack of clarity in branding. (TODO)
        </p>

        <h2>Other opalescent materials</h2>
        TODO

        <h2>Dichroic elements</h2>
        <p>
        Pros: easily splits blue and yellow elements.
        Cons: strong angular dependence is strong.
        TODO: Describe typically available colors (Blaze and Chill) and their color/angle relationship.
